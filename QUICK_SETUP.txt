BRINK Leave System (this zip)

Why changes were not showing for other people
-------------------------------------------
Your previous main app bundle wasn't using Supabase for leave requests (it stored data locally in the browser),
so each person had their own separate data. This version uses Supabase tables + realtime, so everyone sees the same changes.

What to run in Supabase (SQL Editor)
-----------------------------------
1) Run: supabase/schema.sql
2) Run: supabase/admins.sql
3) Run: supabase/app_rls_and_managers.sql

Then...
------
Open:
 - /                -> Request Leave page (public)
 - /manager.html    -> Manager dashboard (email magic link + PIN)
 - /admin.html      -> Admin dashboard (email magic link)
 - /admin-management.html -> Add/remove admins + admin department access

Manager PINs
------------
In Admin Dashboard -> Managers tab
 - Enter manager email + department + PIN, click "Save manager"
 - Manager signs in (magic link) and then enters the PIN to unlock.

Notes
-----
This is a static site. It works on Vercel/Netlify as-is.
Supabase URL + publishable key are stored in js/config.js.
